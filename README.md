### Documentiation and demonstration of the "chachies" directory
The objective of this GitHub repository is to show the documentation and demonstration of the codes in the "chachies" repository.

"Chachies" is a package that can be used to quantitatively analyze raw cycling data as differential capacity plots. Differential capacity plots (dQ/dV) can be very powerful for uncovering battery performance characteristics, as the peaks that appear in these plots correspond to the various electrochemical events. However, because of the large amount of data gathered many researchers report subsets of cycles and purely qualitative conclusions. This package adds the ability to quantify this type of analysis by cleaning battery cycling datasets and obtaining peak locations, widths, amplitudes, and other descriptors for every charge/discharge cycle in the data. To this end, this tool develops individualized models for each charge and discharge cycle in the data set, comprised of a gaussian baseline and pseudo-voigt distributions at each peak location.
